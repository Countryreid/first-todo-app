# Overview
I am learning to use react and trying to build a todo app. The app is simple and is my attempt withoug directly following any tutorial.


Using the npm commands to built a react app. I created first a counter just to implement a button. Then am seeking to add a list of items to the page.

# Web Pages

{Describe each of the web pages you created and how the web app transitions between each of them.  Also describe what is dynamically created on each page.}

# Development Environment

I used the IDE VS code for editing.


I used node.js and react library. 
I used Webdev's css file for styleing

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* It needs to actually create a list rather than just change the text
* I need it to clear out the text box once the button is selected
* I need to add a way to remove the item after adding it.
